# TradingViewProject

This is a project created solely for the purposes of research on Bollinger Bands. It is built in a unique language, specific to the api of TradingView, known as Pinescript. 

Each file controls its own test-based trial.

Each use a unique mathematical dipiction of momentum as a filtering mechanism in order to remove areas of high momentum from the series of potential trades. Then, Bollinger Bands are used to track outliers and predict rebounds in attempts to remove market bias from stochastic processes.

To learn more about the language used & it's specific protocols, refer to the TradingView documentation around PineScript: https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/Introduction.html

BBvADX refers to the algorithm using Bollinger Bands and the Average Directional Movement Index.
BBvRSI refers to the algorithm using Bollinger Bands and the Relative Strength Index.
BBvStoch refers to the lagorithm using Bollinger Bands and the Strong Stochastic Indicator.

Feel free to contact me to run these algorithms or show the resulting research acertained using these programs.
